# bash-config

Configures bashrc with some defaults and installs some software I always need.

Should work on apt-based distributions like Debian and Ubuntu.

## installation

    apt update && apt install -y curl
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaydabi/bash-config/main/install.bsh | bash
